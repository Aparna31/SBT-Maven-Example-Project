This is a sample project structure using Maven and SBT together
for working with Scala. 

It also demonstrates the use of submodules and dependencies along with 
how to run different main methods from within your project

To Test:

# cd into your code directory
git clone git@github.com:jiminoc/SBT-Maven-Example-Project.git

cd SBT-Maven-Example-Project


# We need to do a maven clean install to get the jars in our m2 repository 

mvn clean install

#now you can fire up SBT
sbt

# now you're in the sbt console:
# you can also do other commands like:
reload  // reload any changes you make to the project file

update // update any pom dependencies

compile   // compile all the files

run    // This will run the main class that has some dependencies

run-scraper   // runs the main class from a submodule



# Now you can run the same class via Maven
mvn -pl beagle/scraper exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.gravity.beagle.scraper.ScrapingRunner -e
