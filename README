This is a sample project structure using Maven and SBT together
for working with Scala. 

It also demonstrates the use of submodules and dependencies along with 
how to run different main methods from within your project

To Test:

# cd into your code directory
git clone git@github.com:jiminoc/SBT-Maven-Example-Project.git

cd SBT-Maven-Example-Project

sbt

# now you're in the sbt console:
run    // This will run the main class that has some dependencies

run-scraper   // runs the main class from a submodule


# you can also do other commands like:
reload  // reload any changes you make to the project file

update // update any pom dependencies

compile   // compile all the files
